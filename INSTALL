         Installing PhotoQt
-------------------------------------

 The instructions below serve as a guide to compile and install PhotoQt from source.
 PhotoQt is available in the repositories of an increasing number of Linux distributions.
 In addition, various means of installing PhotoQt (Windows installer, Flatpak, etc.) are
 listed on the website: https://photoqt.org/down

 DEPENDENCIES
--------------
- Qt >= 6.4 (6.5 or higher recommended)
- CMake (needed for building PhotoQt)
- Qt6 ImageFormats

> Make sure that you have the required QML modules installed:
  QtGraphicalEffects, QtMultimedia, QtQuick, QtQuick.Controls,
  QtQuick.Controls.Styles, QtQuick.Layouts, QtQuick.Window,
  QtLocation, QtPositioning, QtCharts

> Dependencies that are searched for by default, but can be disabled via CMake:
- yaml-cpp
- QCA (with rsa/openssl support)
- LibArchive
- Exiv2
- ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick
- LibRaw
- Poppler (can be replaced by QtPDF)
- FreeImage
- DevIL
- pugixml
- libmpv
- Python (incl. pychromecast package)
- ZXing-C++
- LittleCMS

> Dependencies that are disabled by default, but can be enabled via CMake:
- LibVips
- resvg

> Please note that you probably want to have as many of these enabled as possible as
  they greatly enhance the experience of PhotoQt.

> NOTE
  If any enabled dependency is not found, then it will be disabled automatically.
  At the end of the CMake run an overview is provided with all successfully enabled
  and all disabled features.

> NOTE
  On some systems you also need the *-dev package for compiling (e.g.
  exiv2-dev - names can vary slightly depending on your distribution). These
  packages usually can be uninstalled again after compilation is done.

> NOTE
  PhotoQt can work with either ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick, but due to
  conflicting naming schemes it is not possible to use both at the same time.
  By default GraphicsMagick will be enabled in CMake.

> NOTE
  Exiv2 can be compiled with support for the BMFF format. Note that there is the
  possibility that BMFF support may be the subject of patent rights. PhotoQt will
  by default opt-in to reading this format (if supported by Exiv2). If you prefer
  to not include support for this format in PhotoQt simply set the EXIV2_ENABLE_BMFF
  CMake option to OFF.


 ADDITIONAL IMAGE FORMATS
--------------------------

> These are some libraries and tools that can add additional formats to PhotoQt
  if installed. None of them are needed at compile time, but they can be picked
  up at runtime if available.

- KImageFormats - https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kimageformats/html/index.html
- Qt plug-in for AVIF images - https://github.com/novomesk/qt-avif-image-plugin
- Qt plug-in for JPEG XL images - https://github.com/novomesk/qt-jpegxl-image-plugin
- Qt plug-in for HEIF/HEIC images - https://github.com/novomesk/qt-heic-image-plugin
- XCFtools - https://github.com/j-jorge/xcftools
- libqpsd - https://github.com/Code-ReaQtor/libqpsd
- unrar


 BUILDING AND INSTALLING
-------------------------

1) mkdir build && cd build/

2) cmake ..

     # Note: This installs PhotoQt by default into /usr/local/{bin,share}
     # To install PhotoQt into another prefix e.g. /usr/{bin,share}, run:

     cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..

     # At this step you can also en-/disable any compile time features.

3) make  # This creates an executable photoqt binary located in the ./build/ folder

4) (as root or sudo) make install
     # This (  i) is only required if you want to install PhotoQt
     #      ( ii) installs the desktop file to share/applications/
     #      (iii) installs some icons to icons/hicolor/
     #      ( iv) installs the binary to bin/
     #      (  v) installs the metainfo file to share/metainfo/


 UNINSTALL
-----------
 If you want to uninstall PhotoQt, simply run "make uninstall" as root. This removes
 the desktop file (via xdg-desktop-menu uninstall), the icons, the binary file, and
 the metainfo file. Alternatively you can simply remove all the files manually which
 should yield the same result.


 BUILDING ON WINDOWS
---------------------

 PhotoQt offers installers for pre-built binaries on its website:
 https://photoqt.org/downpopupwindows

 If you prefer to build it yourself, this process is not as hard as it might seem at
 first. The main challenge in building PhotoQt on Windows lies in getting the environment
 set up and all dependencies installed.

 The following are required dependencies:

 1) Install Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition (free, be sure to install the 'Desktop
    Development with C++' workload)
    - Website: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/
 2) Install CMake:
    - Website: https://cmake.org/
    - In the installer set the system path option to Add CMake to the system PATH for all
      users
 3) Install Qt 6.4 (6.5+ recommended)
    - Website: https://qt.io
    - In the installer, make sure to install all required modules as listed above under
      dependencies.
    - After installation, confirm that your installation of Qt finds both CMake and the
      compiler installed in steps 1 and 2

 The following dependencies are recommended but can be disabled through CMake if not
 wanted:

 1) yaml-cpp: https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp
 2) QCA: https://invent.kde.org/libraries/qca
 3) LibArchive: https://libarchive.org/
 4) Exiv2: https://exiv2.org/
 5) ImageMagick: https://imagemagick.org/
 6) LibRaw: https://www.libraw.org/
 7) pugixml: https://pugixml.org/
 8) Poppler: https://poppler.freedesktop.org/
 9) FreeImage: https://freeimage.sourceforge.io/
10) DevIL: http://openil.sourceforge.net/
11) ZXing-C++: https://github.com/zxing-cpp/zxing-cpp/
12) LittleCMS: https://littlecms.com/
13) libsai: https://github.com/Wunkolo/libsai

 One easy way to get many of the dependencies is by taking advantage of vcpkg
 (https://vcpkg.io/). A sample vcpkg.conf can be found in the windows/ subfolder.

 Whatever way you obtain the dependencies, make sure that any installed dependency can
 be found by CMake. It might have to be explicitly pointed to the library/include paths of
 some of the dependencies by specifying target_include_directories() and
 target_link_libraries().

 Once all the required and desired dependencies are installed, then the source code of
 PhotoQt can be fetched from the website (https://photoqt.og/down). Then simply follow
 the instructions in the 'BUILDING AND INSTALLING' section above
